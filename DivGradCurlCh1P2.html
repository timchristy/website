<!-- THIS IS WHAT I HAVE SO FAR FOR MATH 
	 Have to sort this out still, but it looks like
	 I can use LaTeX syntax to write equations for now.

	 Havet to use <span lang = "latex"> equation here </span>
	 to get it to work.-->

        <h1>Chapter 1 Problem 2</h1>
            <p>Using arrows, sketch the electric field of a unit positive charge situated at the origin. [Note: You may simplify the problem by confining your sketch to one of the coordinate planes. Does it matter which plane you choose?]</p>

        <p>(a) Write a formula for a vector function in two dimensions which is in the positive radial direction and whose magnitude is 1.</p>
        
        <p>The radial vector is given by $\vec{r} = \vec{i}x + \vec{j}y$. Dividing by the magnitude $|\vec{r}| = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ yields the desired vector function </p>
        
        <div class="problem" align ="center">
       $\vec{F}(x,y) = \frac{\vec{i}x + \vec{j}y}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}$
        </div>
        
        <br>
        <p>(b) Write a formula for a vector function in two dimensions whose direction makes an angle of $45^o$ with the x-axis and whose magnitude at any point (x,y) is $(x+y)^2$</p>
